<summary>Nova Square</summary>

The body font 'Nova Square' was chosen for its striking simplicity. It was created by the famous stonemason [Wojciech Kalinowski](http://www.identifont.com/show?3DQU)

> "In 1995 he began to design his own typefaces for carving in stone, like Medieval Sharp, Gothica, and Modern Antiqua. In second half of the 2000's he became interested in digital typefaces, and began to digitise his old typefaces and design new ones. He is a contributor to the Open Font Library."
