## User Experience 🪄

### Strategy Plane

#### Project Goals

### Scope Plane

#### Feature Identification

### Structure Plane

#### User Stories

#### Database Schema

### Skeleton Plane

#### Wireframes

#### Surface Plane

#### Color Scheme

<details>
<summary>Basic Palette</summary>

Hexadecimal codes that correspond to the company's logo were provided by the client. It was decided 'off-white' would replace the standard white color for text as it creates less of a glare while still maintaining sufficient contrast for accessibility.

![logo-colors](documentation/readme/logo-colors.png)

The colors were then imported into the base.css page and assigned as root colors for ease of use (and all elements using the tags can be instantly amended site-wide in future if the logo changes).

#### Fonts

<details>
<summary>Horta</summary>

The headline font 'Horta' is used in the company logo and has an open font license.

> "Inspired by the title cards of the original Star Trek television series—even supports Klingon!"

</details>

<details>
<summary>Nova Square</summary>

The body font 'Nova Square' was chosen for its striking simplicity. It was created by the famous stonemason [Wojciech Kalinowski](http://www.identifont.com/show?3DQU)

> "In 1995 he began to design his own typefaces for carving in stone, like Medieval Sharp, Gothica, and Modern Antiqua. In second half of the 2000's he became interested in digital typefaces, and began to digitise his old typefaces and design new ones. He is a contributor to the Open Font Library."
