Emerg3D Props was born out of a unique passion and a deep-seated desire to join the prestigious 501st Legion. Faced with
a lack of choices in Europe, I took the initiative to invest in a revolutionary technology: 3D printing. What began as a
project to create just one costume quickly blossomed into an all-consuming passion for 3D printing.<br><br>
